NoSpawnerXP
======

NoSpawnerXP is a plugin for CanaryMod. It disables the dropping of XP
for mob spawners, for use in servers where mob spawners are mineable.

This plugin should not interfere with most other plugins.

Building
--------

Before building, put `CanaryMod.jar` and `minecraft_servero.jar` in the `lib/`
folder. Then run `ant` to generate `dist/NoSpawnerXP.jar`.
